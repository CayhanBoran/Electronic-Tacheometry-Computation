# Electronic-Tacheometry-Computation
  Tacheometry is a method which is used to determine the location of topographic details. This method determines the polar coordinates of detail points via horizontal angle and horizontal distance from stations and their elevation via slope distance and vertical angle. Electronic tacheometric observations can be carried out by using a total station and reflector.
  
  A program to calculate an electronic tacheometry computation. The input values (coordinates and heights of station and target traverse points, horizontal and vertical angle calculated for detail point, instrument and reflector heights, pointIDs), point IDs) for the program should be entered by the user manually. The results of the calculations will be printed properly.
